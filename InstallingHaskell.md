To preface the actual post; this blog will purely be covering my own personal experience with Haskell on Windows. 
As such, readers on Mac or Linux may find discrepancies between my experience and their own.
# Installing Haskell

I folllowed the instructions on the haskell website, which you can find [here](https://www.haskell.org/platform/). 
This requires you to install Chocolatey, which for the purpose of installing haskell, is the platform through which haskell is downloaded. These installations took a bit of time on my laptop, but you do need to give permission to install throughout the process for different subprograms, so it's probably best to supervise the process fully.

Once you have both Chocolately and Haskell installed, you should be ready to start writing code.

## But how do I write code in Haskell?
If you are interested in writing code in Haskell, you are most likely doing it because you are interested in the lack of overhead. What this means, is that Haskell is a great language for writing other languages. You can create your own data types and functions for those datatypes without having to use any of the functions or datatypes built into the language.

Of course, you still have to follow basic Haskell syntax in order for your code to be understood by the compiler. In the next post, I'll discuss some basic syntax as well as how to compile your code.
